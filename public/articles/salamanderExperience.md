As you may or may not have known, I was a salamander for ten years. I never really gave any consideration to any of the books I really burnt until I had some of my own in possession and realized the value of them with the aid of Clarisse and Faber. I want to give some of the experiences I had as a salamander and overall the general feel of the job.

### Leisure Activities

Since society was quite complient with having no books, we often didn't need to go places and burn books. We passed a lot of the time playing cards and just wasting time. Unsurprisingly, the salamanders didn't exchange many deep words that motivated deep conversations. We would just announce our plays during the game and communicate with each other during our jobs. In fact, probably the salamander who I got the most conversation out of was Beatty, but even then Beatty was well aware of the things that I did as well as doing those things himself. I often wonder if the other salamanders were like me at one point, and had their hopes destroyed by Beatty.

### The Actual Job

Things really got interesting once the alarm went off and we were off on our beetle cruising at 70 mph. It was almost instantaneous that we were at the culprit's house, ready to burn completely everything. After that, we would just go back to the headquarters and wait for more alarms, pretty simple. I don't remember a lot of the alarms that I responded to, however one alert that will always be burned *(pun not intended)* into my head is the time where we burned a woman alive inside of her house. I was so traumatized by this, I wouldn't get out of bed for an entire day, I was even thinking about quitting the job! Beatty had to come around and console me just so I wouldn't quit the job and tried to get me to stop feeling empathy for the woman we had burned that day.

### My Coworkers and The Mechanical Hound

My coworkers, as I said before, didn't really talk with me that much on a personal level. In fact, they all had about the same looks as I did, we were all the same! It's like they had just manufactured salamanders to go and burn houses all over again. Though, one thing we did do quite a lot was make bets involving The Mechanical Hound. Surely you've seen The Mechanical Hound before, the big and scary, dead and alive, dog that could rip someone's head off if it wanted to. We would constantly make bets to see what animal it would kill first, I remember losing a week's worth of salary once on that, boy was Mildred upset after that! Other than that, The Mechanical Hound scared me quite a bit and was quite aggressive towards me. This was no coincidence, as Beatty had expected me for having books in the first place and programmed The Mechanical Hound to be aggressive towards me and sniff me out because of that. It's quite saddening to me actually, as I was very fascinated with The Mechanical Hound. Maybe we could've been friends in some alternate universe.

To be honest, I give this job a solid 4/10, main reason being because of how boring it is. The only really fun thing about it was making bets on The Mechanical Hound and the alarms themselves. Looking back on them though, all of it was really pointless, and I'm glad I'm out of that sort of job as I never want to barge into someone's house again and burn their books.
